Thesis Defense
==============

This repository consists of the assets used for my thesis defense on April 6th 2020.
The file "slides.html" contains a viewer for my slides. Unfortunately, it currently only works correctly with a very specific window size.
Eventually I will sort out how to get the offsets for the written svg overlays consistent. In the meantime, it probably won't work without manually fiddling with the numbers on a device-by-device basis. =(
